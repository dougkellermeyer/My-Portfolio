        <p id="bio" class="animated fadeIn">The past 3 years spent in IT recruiting has been an incredible journey. Coming out of school with a Chemistry degree,
            I knew that I loved solving problems, but wasn't sure what career I wanted to pursue. While I really enjoyed
            working in a research lab, I was missing the interaction with others. I'm truly at my best when I'm working with
            a group of people; something about working with others really engages my mind in ways I can't on my own. Recruiting
            allowed me to combine my technical and people skills to help others find the next step in their career. </p>
        <p id="bio" class="animated fadeIn">Recruiting also helped further develop my soft skills, as I had to communicate on a daily basis with a wide range
            of both technical and non-technical people. It also opened my eyes to the world of software development. Software,
            like Chemistry, is made up of simple building blocks that can be combined to create new solutions to just about
            anything.
        </p>

        <p id="bio" class="animated fadeIn">For the past 6-months I've been attending a full stack bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University in order to transition
            into software development, which is where I really want to be.</p>
